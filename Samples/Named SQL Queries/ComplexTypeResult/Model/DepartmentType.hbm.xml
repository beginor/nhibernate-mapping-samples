<!--
Note: NHibernate runtime does not allow mapping a query result to a type having no xml-mapping.
      This is either a bug or a minor defect that can be avoided by writing manually the xml-mapping for the complex type and adding it. In this mapping property descriptions and an identifier for the complex type must be defined.
